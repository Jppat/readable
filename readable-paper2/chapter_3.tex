\chapter{Research Methodology}
This chapter lists and discusses the specific steps and activities that will be performed to accomplish the project.

\section{Research Activities}
For this paper, we will be utilizing the Kaldi ASR toolkit. Kaldi is popular when it comes to automatic speech recognition because it is flexible and accessible compared to the other ASR toolkits. For the audio file, three speakers will utter two-to-three syllables of Hiligaynon words. These audio files will be grouped and classified as testing and training data. Each audio file has a corresponding transcription text document that will help in achieving an accurate model result. Speakers are also required to record the given words clearly and audibly. Different speakers for the testing and training audio data will be observed to yield an unbiased result.

One important key component for the Kaldi to function is its various phonemes. These phonemes were paired with words from the systemâ€™s local dictionary. The table below shows the phonemes that will be used in this study.

\section{Calendar of Activities}

A Gantt chart showing the schedule of the activities should be included as a table. For example:

Table \ref{tab:timetableactivities} shows a Gantt chart of the activities.  Each bullet represents approximately
one week worth of activity.

%
%  the following commands will be used for filling up the bullets in the Gantt chart
%
\newcommand{\weekone}{\textbullet}
\newcommand{\weektwo}{\textbullet \textbullet}
\newcommand{\weekthree}{\textbullet \textbullet \textbullet}
\newcommand{\weekfour}{\textbullet \textbullet \textbullet \textbullet}

%
%  alternative to bullet is a star
